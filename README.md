# pixels - a web audio api experiment

![pixels](images/demo.png)

The first version of this project was made 2015. I refactored the code and decided to put it online since I liked the core idea. The first time I saw the web3 audio api I was shocked by how powerful and cool it was. You can put any song you want and the pixels will visualize the sounds.
